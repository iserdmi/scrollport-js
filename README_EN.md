# Scrollport.js
Scrollport.js - not your boring plugin for scrolling animation. See [demo](http://serdmi.com/demo/scrollport/) for possible uses.

Plug-in can not only animate the scroll, but also to assign references by clicking on which to begin the animation.

## Use
```js
  $.scrollport( target [, options ] );
  $.scrollport( target [, container ] [, options ] );

  $.scrollport( top, [, options ] );
  $.scrollport( top, [, container ] [, options ] );

  $.scrollport( top, left, [, options ] );
  $.scrollport( top, left, [, container ] [, options ] );

  container.scrollport( target [, options ] );
  container.scrollport( top [, options ] );
  container.scrollport( top, left [, options ] );
```
* ** `target` **
Either the object dzheykveri or selector element, which will be scrolling.

* ** `container` ** default `$(window)`
Object dzheykveri inside which will be scrolling.

* ** `top` **
Number of pixels from the top edge of the `container`. The specified point will be scrolling.

* ** `left` **
Number of pixels from the left edge of the `container`. The specified point will be scrolling.

* ** `options` **
Settings responsible for scroll mode, scroll details and callbacks.

## Settings

The plugin has four modes depending on the selected mode will be added to the individual settings. The following are options which can be set regardless of the selected mode.

* ** `interrupt` **
Set to `true` or `false`, setting the same value for the options `interrupt_user` and `interrupt_scrollport`

* ** `container` **
Dzheykveri element inside which will be scrolling. As you can see, the container can be set not only as an argument in a call to the plugin, but the pass option settings. The result will be the same.

* ** `delta` ** default `{top: 0, left: 0}`
The value of `top` determines how many pixels from the top should be "do not reach" to `target`. The value of `left` determines the number of pixels on the left. If you pass the optional number, it will be assumed that you pass `{top: your_number, left: 0} '.

* ** `on_start` **
The function that will be called at the start of the movement. The argument passed to the function API. `this` will contain a `container`.

* ** `on_interrupt` **
The function to be called when the plugin is interrupted user scrolls. The argument passed to the function API. `this` will contain a `container`.

* ** `on_finish` **

## Changing default settings

```js
  $.scrollport( options );
```

## Scrollport Links

Clicking on the link will be created by the plugin. All references to the attribute `data-scrollport` will be automatically assigned to be a scrollport anchor. If you do not pass any one of the values ​​`target`, `top` or `left`, then `target` will automatically attribute value `data-scrollport` or `href`, or `data-href`.

```js
  link.scrollport_link( [ target ] [, options ] );
  link.scrollport_link( [ target ] [, container ] [, options ] );

  link.scrollport_link( top, [, options ] );
  link.scrollport_link( top, [, container ] [, options ] );

  link.scrollport_link( top, left, [, options ] );
  link.scrollport_link( top, left, [, container ] [, options ] );
```
* ** `link` **
Object target, which will link to a scrollport anchor.

## API

API access can be obtained as follows:
```js
  // When the initialization of the plugin.
  api = $.scrollport( ... );

  // API passed to the function of any callback.
  $.scrollport( ..., {
    on_finish: function( api ) {
      ...
    }
  });
```

* ** `api.options` **
Options passed to the initialization, combined with the default settings.

* ** `api.status` **
At the time of initialization status `init`. If the failure occurred during initialization or initialization value it will be abolished `cancel`. During the movement of `motion`. After the interruption of `interrupt`. Upon successful completion, `finish`.

* ** `api.container` **
Dzheykveri object passed as the `container` initialization.

* ** `api.target` **
If the goal was transferred selector or object dzheykveri, `api.target` will contain targeted element. If the goal were the coordinates, the object will be `api.target` type `{top: ..., left: ...}`


## Examples

```js
  // In the "usual" to move the scroll to top of the page.
  $.scrollport( 'body' );

  // In the "soft" to move the scroll 500 pixels from the top of the page
  $.scrollport( 500, { mode: 'soft' } );

  // In the "hard" to move the scroll element with id "my_container" to a point 100 pixels to the right of the beginning of the container, and 40 pixels below.
  $( '#my_container' ).scrollport( 100, 100, { 
    mode: 'hard'
    delta: 60
  } );
 
  // In the "usual" to move the scroll to the item page id "my_element". At the end of the motion to withdraw the status skrollporta console.
  $.scrollport( '#my_element', { 
    on_stop: function( api ) {
      console.log( api.status );
    }
  } );
```
